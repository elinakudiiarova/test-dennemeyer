Assumptions and considerations

First of all, in the scope of this task I was not making assumptions about such scenarios as:
- deleting current proposal,
- creating new proposal with other companies,
- expiration dates on proposals if there are such,
- etc.

Assumption 1: While proposal is not approved by everyone, item isnâ€™t being shared.
Assumption 2: The user is associated with only one party, party can have multiple users.
Assumption 3: The item can only have one proposal per time. Parties can have multiple open negotiations. 
Assumption 4: The item always has one owner, other parties just share it.
Assumption 5: We do not need Auth in the task, so we can use userId to validate if a user is in the system at least.
Assumption 6: When we start negotiations for an item, we can not reject without counter-proposal.
Assumption 7: After party has made its decision, it can not redo it.
Assumption 8: If one party has declined proposal, the proposal can be closed because it will not be successful anymore and we have received a new proposal. 
Assumption 9: If I delete party, I want all users to be deleted.
Assumption 10: If item will be deleted, proposals to be deleted too.
Assumption 11: In Story 2 negotiation process can be only seen by the parties that are in the process of negotiations. 
Assumption 12: On the proposal creation our Amount of value should be 100.
Assumption 13: Amount or Percentage must be provided, but not both.
Assumption 14: Amount or Percentage must be more than 0.

Consideration 1: Status decisions should be separate for each party.
Consideration 2: Using EF Core with code-first approach.
Consideration 3: We should save create user to proposal and decision user to party-proposal.
Consideration 4: Saving nullable Percentage and non-nullable Amount gives an ability to show on UI how users have entered values.


I definetely made more assumptions and considerations, but these are the ones that I have written.
